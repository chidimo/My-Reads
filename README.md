## The project

This is a bookshelf written in `React`. It is meant to keep track of books which I'm currently reading, Wants to read, and already read. Books can be moved around shelves by clicking on the green arrow at the bottom right corner of a book and selecting the desired shelf.

The app also incorporates a search function which can be launched by clicking on the + sign at the bottom right corner of the page.
